              information about how and when you use our Services, and other
              technical information. This information is primarily needed to
              maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our
              internal analytics and reporting purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies
              and similar technologies.

            <p>The information we collect includes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Log and Usage Data. Log and usage data is service-related,
                diagnostic, usage, and performance information our servers
                automatically collect when you access or use our Services and
                which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with

                information, browser type, and settings and information about
                your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps

                Location Data. We collect location data such as information
                about your device's location, which can be either precise or
                imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type
                and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For

                geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on
                your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this
                information either by fefusing access to the information or by

                the Services.

            provide information so that we can match it with information you
            have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of
            request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so
            that we can match the information you provide with the information
            we already have on file, or we may contact you through a
            communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously

            possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you
            for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your
            identity from the information already maintained by us, we may
            request that you provide additional information for the purposes of
            verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention
            purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as
            soon as we finish verifying you.
